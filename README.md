# OwnLoop

> Your coding agent writes the code. You keep the understanding.

OwnLoop is an early-stage, local-first human ownership layer for AI-assisted software development.

The project observes a coding-agent Task Run, captures verifiable changes and evidence, and turns only the most meaningful changes, decisions, risks, and understanding checks into a finite Build Replay and evidence-backed Ownership Moments.

## Current status

- Stage: v0.1 local Raw Replay implementation
- Product scope: proposed v0.1
- First coding-agent adapter: Claude Code
- First project languages: JavaScript and TypeScript
- Runtime model: local single-user prototype
- Repository state: local ingestion, evidence capture, finalization, and authenticated Raw Replay viewer

## Local setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js `24.18.0` (also pinned in `.nvmrc` and `package.json#engines`)
- pnpm `11.4.0` (also pinned in `package.json#packageManager`)

Install the exact package-manager version and dependencies:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.4.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Start the daemon bootstrap and React development viewer together:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The React page renders the Raw Replay connection shell. Authenticated Run data is available when a
caller constructs the existing loopback server with persistence, the OL-010 artifact store, and the
optional built web root. Production startup configuration remains explicit; the daemon entrypoint does
not invent database, token, artifact-root, or listener settings.

## Verification

Run the same quality gates used by continuous integration:

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Use `pnpm format` to apply formatting.

The shared packages provide strict ingress, Event, and Raw Replay contracts. The daemon modules expose
authenticated ingress, evidence capture, finalization, replay projection, and contained same-origin
static delivery. The Claude Code hook adapter remains fail-open and outside the agent critical path.

## Design principles

- Evidence before explanation
- AI proposes; deterministic systems verify
- Local-first privacy
- Finite experience rather than infinite engagement
- OwnLoop remains outside the coding agent's critical path in v0.1
- Zero moments is a valid outcome

## Planned first vertical slice

```text
Claude Code hook
→ local ingestion
→ append-only event storage
→ Task Run lifecycle
→ Git baseline and final reconciliation
→ deterministic raw replay
```

Ownership Moment generation begins only after the capture-and-replay foundation is trustworthy.

## Contribution state

The project is currently maintained by a one-person team. Architecture and scope changes should be recorded through ADRs. Implementation work should follow the dependency order in the v0.1.0 backlog.
