# OwnLoop

> Your coding agent writes the code. You keep the understanding.

OwnLoop is an early-stage, local-first human ownership layer for AI-assisted software development.

The project observes a coding-agent Task Run, captures verifiable changes and evidence, and turns only the most meaningful changes, decisions, risks, and understanding checks into a finite Build Replay and evidence-backed Ownership Moments.

## Current status

- Stage: v0.1 finite Ownership Moment rendering
- Product scope: proposed v0.1
- First coding-agent adapter: Claude Code
- First project languages: JavaScript and TypeScript
- Runtime model: local single-user prototype
- Repository state: trustworthy deterministic evidence foundation, strict Candidate generation/validation, and read-only finite Ownership Moment rendering in development

## Local setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js `24.18.0` (also pinned in `.nvmrc` and `package.json#engines`)
- pnpm `11.4.0` (also pinned in `package.json#packageManager`)

Install the exact package-manager version and dependencies:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.4.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Start the daemon bootstrap and React development viewer together:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The React page renders the Raw Replay connection shell. Authenticated Run data is available when a
caller constructs the existing loopback server with persistence, the OL-010 artifact store, and the
optional built web root. Production startup configuration remains explicit; the daemon entrypoint does
not invent database, token, artifact-root, listener, or provider settings.

## Verification

Run the same quality gates used by continuous integration:

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Use `pnpm format` to apply formatting.

The shared packages provide strict ingress, Event, Raw Replay, change-classification, verification-evidence, Evidence Graph, Candidate Moment, semantic-input, Candidate-generation, Candidate-validation, and Ownership-Moment projection contracts. The daemon modules expose authenticated ingress, evidence capture, finalization, replay projection, contained same-origin static delivery, deterministic evidence processors, Run-scoped evidence resolution, explicit provider-backed Candidate generation, deterministic Candidate validation, and a read-only selected-Moment projection. The React viewer renders those selected proposals separately from persisted supporting facts and keeps all OL-020 responses in page memory only. The Claude Code hook adapter remains fail-open and outside the agent critical path.

## Design principles

- Evidence before explanation
- AI proposes; deterministic systems verify
- Local-first privacy
- Finite experience rather than infinite engagement
- OwnLoop remains outside the coding agent's critical path in v0.1
- Zero moments is a valid outcome

### Architecture

## Planned first vertical slice

```text
Claude Code hook
→ local ingestion
→ append-only event storage
→ Task Run lifecycle
→ Git baseline and final reconciliation
→ deterministic raw replay
→ deterministic file/change evidence
→ deterministic verification evidence
→ deterministic locally resolvable Evidence Graph
→ strict evidence-backed Candidate Moment contract
→ deterministic reduced and redacted semantic-analysis input
→ explicit provider-backed Candidate proposal generation
→ deterministic Candidate validation, deduplication, ranking, and finite selection
→ read-only finite Ownership Moment projection and local Evidence navigation
```

Candidate generation is an explicit, disabled-by-default proposal boundary. Provider output is never treated as evidence. OL-019 resolves Evidence IDs against the exact Evidence Graph, rejects unsupported or contradictory proposals, groups deterministic duplicates, and ranks at most seven finite selections. OL-020 reads only that verified selection, joins it to the exact verified source Candidate batch, and renders provider proposal wording separately from deterministic supporting facts and proposal signals.

## Contribution state

The project is currently maintained by a one-person team. Architecture and scope changes should be recorded through ADRs. Implementation work should follow the dependency order in the v0.1.0 backlog.

## Current milestone

OL-020 projects only the `valid_selected` source Candidates from one verified current-policy OL-019 validation, in deterministic rank order and with a hard maximum of seven. The existing authenticated loopback viewer displays provider-proposed wording separately from persisted support and provider ranking signals, resolves every exposed Evidence ID through the Run-scoped OL-015 resolver, and keeps acknowledgement, answers, responses, and usefulness feedback only in React page memory. No migration, interaction persistence, write endpoint, provider call, or new browser-security boundary is introduced.
